# Isomorphic Strings

1. If the length of the 2 input strings are not equal, then return `false`.
2. Create a Map to keep track.
3. Loop over either string, we'll use the first argument.
4. Check to see if the Map already has value. Example:

```
Map = {}
s = add
t = cpp
```

It would add in the first iteration that `a: c`. Next, it would set `d:p`. This would help keep track to see if it has seen the value before or if it is equivalent through each iteration of the loop.
